All *.scss files in the Styles/ directory are compiled to *.css files in wwwroot/css/ except for:

    Files with names that start with an underscore (partials)

Compiled files preserve their path, e.g. Styles/home/index.scss compiles to wwwroot/css/home/index.css

The build:sass and dev:sass NPM tasks are responsible for the compilation.

In order for the NPM tasks to be run automatically when the project is opened, you need to have the NPMTaskRunner extension installed in Visual Studio:
